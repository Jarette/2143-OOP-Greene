# OOP Terminology

## Abstraction

Abstraction is a fundamental concept of computer science but also a key 
concept of Object Oriented Programming. Abstraction simply is the 
practice showing only the relevant information and hiding all
the irrelevant information.

## Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the grouping of data and functions together and hiding 
thier implementation by restricting the access using access modifiers
to keep selected pieces private.

### Example of Encapsulation: 
```
class Myclass{
    private:

        // attributes and methods

    protected:
    
        // attributes and methods

    public:

        // attributes and methods
}
```
